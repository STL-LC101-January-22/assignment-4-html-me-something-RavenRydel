                     Despite the game's main focus being, well, death; Spiritfarer is a heartwarming game about ferrying souls into the afterlife. The main character, Stella, has to bond with spirits in order to help them move on, and yes, this includes cooking food because nothing says "Let's be friends." more than a delicious meal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Spiritfarer's food is number five on my list because although the meals look adorable and scrumptious, most of them take on a more practical appearance. The fresh ingredients are either fished out of the ocean or grown on Stella's ship. However, there's nothing cuter than giving a spirit their favorite food when they were still alive.

                     Raise livestock, grow crops, befriend the locals, and prepare delicious meals in this cozy management farming game. The game starts with the main character growing tired of his day-to-day office life and opts for their late grandfather’s offer of moving to the countryside.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Stardew Valley’s food design may be in pixel art; however, I enjoy the variety of real meals mixed in with fantasy meals and the overall lore for each dish. In addition, the fact that this game and all of its assets, from the art to the music, was created by only one person has gained my respect for this game even more. Which is why Stardew Valley is number four on my list.

                     Genshin Impact is an open-world action RPG that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. The different characters are randomly earned via a gacha-like system when leveling up. A feature of the game is being able to collect raw materials in order to craft different items, one of which includes food.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Genshin Impact has earned the number three spot on this list because the food in this game is irresistibly adorable; from the ramen with puppy stamped fish cakes to the rice bowl with rice in the shape of a cat. Fantasy meals based heavily on Asian cuisine coupled with the fact that it looks incredibly mouth-watering easily places this game’s food higher up on the list.

                     Like most Zelda games, Link discovers that he’s actually the fabled hero of Hyrule; however, unlike most Zelda games, Link is able to traverse a heavily open-world land via horse, gliding, or even by climbing. In order to gain health and status boosts to help the player survive the harsh elements, Link can collect a wide variety of materials and ingredients. These ingredients can be cooked in a giant wok on an open campfire to create a multitude of foods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Breath of the Wild is number two on my list because the atmosphere is incredible. The sound that comes from the food cooking, the excitement of throwing mysterious ingredients into a giant wok, and the satisfaction of discovering a new meal all adds to the charm of this game that I don’t feel from any other game. Plus, you can make monster cake which is the cutest cake I’ve ever seen in a video game.

                     Animal Crossing: New Horizons starts off like most Animal Crossing games where you move to an unknown place and set up a home and befriend your neighbors. In this particular Animal Crossing game; however, the player moves to an inhabited island that they slowly have to turn into a town over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Coming in at number one, Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ food truly brings a new horizon on the selection of adorable foods in video games. Cooked via stove using collected recipes from your neighbors, friends, and travels around the island. The food in game not only comes as sprites but also as placeable models, allowing you to spruce up a dining table, set up the perfect picnic table, or prepare the best birthday party for your neighbors and friends.
